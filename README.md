# Foreign Direct Investment Analytics

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India over the last 17 years (2000-01 to 2016-17). The dataset contains sector and financial year-wise data of FDI in India. By applying various analytical techniques, we aim to uncover trends, identify key metrics, and provide insights to guide investment decisions and policy-making.

## Problem Statement

Investment is inherently a game of understanding historical data under different events, yet it remains a game of chances. To minimize risk, we apply analytics to find equilibrium in investment. Specifically, this project aims to:

- Conduct sector-wise investment analysis.
- Perform year-wise investment analysis.
- Identify key metrics and factors.
- Show meaningful relationships between different attributes in the dataset.
- Conduct research to uncover findings that can guide investment decisions and policy-making.

## Objectives

### Understand the Trends
- Examine yearly trends in FDI to identify periods of significant growth or decline.
- Determine how investments have evolved over time and identify any patterns or anomalies.

### Sector-Wise Analysis
- Analyze FDI distribution across different sectors to identify which sectors have attracted the most investment.
- Understand the sectoral preferences of foreign investors and highlight key sectors driving FDI.

### Identify Key Metrics
- Calculate and interpret key metrics such as total investments, yearly growth rates, and sector-wise contributions.
- Identify meaningful relationships between different attributes in the dataset.

### Business Problems and Solutions
- **Investment Diversification Analysis**: How diversified are FDI investments across different sectors, and has this diversification changed over time?
- **Identification of Emerging Sectors**: Which sectors have shown recent significant increases in FDI, indicating emerging investment trends?
- **Investment Stability Analysis**: Which sectors have the most stable FDI inflows, and which are the most volatile?
